Starvation

** Non-Preemptive = Scheduler waits until running job blocks/yields  **
** Preemptive = Scheduler can interrupt running jobs  **

1. First-Come First Served (FCFS)
	- Could result in starvation
	- All long jobs comes before short jobs; all jobs behind large one could potentially starve
	- High turnaround time (Tfinish - Tstart)

2. Shortest Job First (SJF)(Non-Preemptive)
	- Starving can occur to long jobs
	- When there are a lot of short jobs that keep coming in, then the long jobs will just starve while
		short jobs are being run.

3. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)(Preemptive)
	- Like shortest job first, starvation can occur to long jobs
	- If jobs with small run times are continuatlly add, the larger job will be starved

4. Round Robin(RR)
	- Starvation does not occur in round robin because all jobs have equal quantum time to run

5. Priority
	- Starvation occures on low-priority jobs
	- Solution is "Age" process 
		-> Age jobs on low priorities so they have high prescedence as they wait longer
