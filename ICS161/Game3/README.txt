ICS 161: Game 3
Unity Chan Land

This game is a top down two player shooter, that heavily relies on teamwork. You and your partner arrived in a suspicious town with a broken down car. You and your partner need to find some materials to fix up your ride and get out of the town. As you search the area, you may find more than you are looking for. The goal is to survive while searching for the required materials to fix your ride. Remember in this town, the only one you can trust is your partner and yourself.

I want the players to feel adventurous, excited and teamwork. There is a constant wave of pressure put on the players as they search around for what they need. That should spark some excitement as you shoot your enemies down. However, to beat the game teamwork is essential, you cannot do this alone.
