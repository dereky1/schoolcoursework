ICS 161: Game 1
Block Breakers

This game is a simple launch an object into more objects game. The goal of the game is to shoot the ball into structures and try to knock as much as you can into the water. Each block will be one point. The ball is mainly powered by a strong foward force, but can be slightly controlled midflight.

I want the players to feel relaxed as this is a simple game. They should also feel stress relief through the destruction of objects.
