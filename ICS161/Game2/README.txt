ICS 161: Game 2
Unity Chan Land

This game is a simple scavenger hunt like game. The player must go through the map to find the items required to escape the area. The player can interact with a lot of the terrain. The character can walk, run and jump around and even get to drive a car. The character can also interact with the chests around the map and when the player finds an axe, they can cut down trees and bushes. The map is relatively big, so being too easy is not an issue. There are many "fake" objects scatter around the world, and it is up to the player to find the real ones and survive.

I want the players to feel adventurous and curious. There are many objects in the world and I want the player to explore them. Hard work pays off. This game may not be suitable for players with little patients, because looking for the key and car may take a while. You have been warned.
