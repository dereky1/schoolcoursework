function [I_target,tindex] = warp(I_source,pts_source,pts_target,tri)

%
% I_source : color source image  (HxWx3)
% pts_source : coordinates of keypoints in the source image  (2xN)
% pts_target : coordinates of where the keypoints end up after the warp (2xN)
% tri : list of triangles (triples of indices into pts_source)  (Kx3)
%       for example, the coordinates of the Tth triangle should be 
%       given by the expression:
%
%           pts_source(:,tri(T,:))
% 
%
% I_target : resulting warped image, same size as source image (HxWx3)
% tindex : HxW array of indices which specifies the index of the 
%          triangle for each each pixel of the resulting warped image 
%          (I_target).  If a pixel does not fall in any triangle, you
%          should set tindex to 0.

% and pts_target are both inside the dimensions of the image

% maps it to points in the source

end


% for each pixel in the target image, figure
% out which triangle it falls inside so we 
% know which transformation to use for those
% pixels
%
%  tindex(i,j) should contain a value in [1...num_tri]
%    which indicate what triangle contains pixel (i,j)
%
%  you can leave tindex(i,j) = 0 if pixel (i,j) doesn't
%  fall inside any triangle.
%    
tindex = zeros(h,w);
for t = 1:num_tri
  % get the 3 corners of this triangle t
  corners = pts_target(:,tri(t,:));

  % generate a binary mask image of size HxW which is 
  % 1 for pixels that are inside the triangle and 0 otherwise
  mask = poly2mask(corners(1,:),corners(2,:),h,w);
  for i=1:h
      for j=1:w
